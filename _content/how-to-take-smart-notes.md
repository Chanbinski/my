If you're a student, researcher, or writer, how do you write? Do you think of a topic, plan out your research by brainstorming, devour books and articles, and finally write your first draft? Almost every academic guide to writing describes this process. However, this way of writing is dead wrong. In order to discover a great question or topic, one must put a lot of effort into reading and research beforehand, not afterwards. Moreover, if you follow this linear process of writing, you will probably fall into what psychologists refer to as the confirmation bias, the tendency to only accept information that supports one's prior belief. That is, if we set a topic and then do the research, we will probably gather insights that only support our claim, leaving out those that contradict with. The main claim of Sonke Ahrens' book, "How to Take Smart Notes" is that **writing should never start from scratch**.

## The Slip-Box Method

Considered one of the most influential sociologists in the 20th century, Niklas Luhmann published 58 books and hundreds of articles throughout his academic career. Behind Luhmann's considerable accomplishment is his slip-box. Whenever he read something, he wrote brief notes (literature notes) and put them into the first slip-box or, the bibliographical box. Then, he translated these notes into permanent notes that are concise and context-wise independent. He would put these notes into the main slip-box, linking pre-existing notes that are related to the new note. Finally, whenever he wanted to find a topic for his writing, he would peak inside his slip-box and look at the connections, turning the connected notes into a rough draft!

The true power of this workflow is accumulation. As the slip-box grows, its usage grows exponentially. This is because links are usually not made one to one, but one to many. The slip-box system is actually very simple, but simple isn't the same word for easy. The next part is a detailed explanation of the steps.

## How It Works

0. Take Fleeting Notes.

   - Write down any insights that come to you on an everyday basis.

1. Take Literature Notes.

   - Always take down literature notes when reading something.
   - Be extremely **selective** when making these notes. This allows you to master various academic skills such as summarizing, faster reading, and critical thinking.
   - **Rephrase** the content in your language. You fully understand when you paraphrase.

2. Take Permanent Notes.

   - Turn the fleeting notes and literature notes into permanent notes every one or two days.
   - Make sure each note is concise and **independent** of the context. This process of abstraction is very important because it allows **connections** between permanent notes. You cannot make any meaningful connections if the notes are in each of their contexts. Thus, you should always think of how this new note will relate to other notes already in the slip-box.
   - One research found out that it is the ability to think beyond the context that differentiates successful doctoral candidates from others. Writing permanent notes won't only grow the size of the slip-box but also your academic skills.

3. Add Permanent Notes into the Slip-Box.

   - Give each note a unique alphanumerical id, and if a note is directly related to the one existing in the slip-box, the id of the new note should be following the id of the existing note. (If the id of the preceding note is 1a, the id of the following one would be 1b. If 1b already exists, it would be 1aa)
   - Link different permanent notes. This is the most important part of the workflow because through these connections, new insights are born. Steve Jobs once said, "Creativity is just connecting things."

4. Make Keyword Notes.

   - Remember that it is impossible to get an overview of the slip-box, just like getting an overview of our internal memory is impossible. However, you might want some overview of topics. So you would create keyword notes and link them to the permanent notes which you think starts a topic. When writing keywords, you shouldn't write the most relevant word but find a word that you would want to stumble upon later. This is because this workflow isn't about storing information, but **retrieving** it.

5. Frequently Look Inside the Slip-Box to Find Connections.

   - You must not use the slip-box as storage of knowledge like Wikipedia, but something that you should interact with to discover surprising connections.

6. Write
   - If you have a stream of notes that can be directly turned into a good piece of academic work, you are ready to write. The topics you find inside the slip-box are what you are actually **interested** in.

## Final Thoughts

There are a lot of advantages of this workflow that I didn't mention, so you should definitely check out the book. The slip-box not only makes us a better writer but a better reader and learner. This book is very well written in the sense that it's very logical and cohesive. I'm pretty sure the author followed the slip-box manual when writing this book. I'm actually implementing this workflow digitally using Roam Research, and I'm planning to write about this after trying out the slip-box system for a few months.

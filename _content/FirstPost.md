Hi, welcome to my blog. If you didn't check out my profile yet, visit here. Anyway, this is my first blog post, and I plan to constantly upload my thoughts here. I think a blog is the perfect place to display my interests, opinions, and projects. Moreover, it's always a good thing to keep track of these in one place, because they will eventually accumulate and elevate my personal brand. Coding my personal blog from scratch was always one of my dreams.

Although I've been coding for about 4 years, I was unfamiliar with web programming. After I decided to get some hands-on-experience in this field, I studied various languages and frameworks, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Django, mainly through YouTube videos. I didn't want to study any backend services since my only purpose was to create a personal blog.

One day, I came across Next.js. It is considered as one of the best React framework to create static sites because of its powerful features like server-side rendering (SSR), search engine optimization (SEO), and automatic routing. Because I had some basic knowledge in React, I started to work on my personal blog with this framework.

Of course, I didn't build this website all by myself. I structured my basic layout and applied data extraction from Markdown files referring to this [post](https://medium.com/geekculture/build-a-blog-with-next-js-2315d9683ef) by Matthew Brown. Then, I watched Harry Wolff's YouTube series, _How To Build A Blog With Next.js And Tailwind_ ([Github Repository](https://github.com/hswolff/blog-with-nextjs-and-tailwind) for the episodes), realizing how powerful Tailwind CSS was. I deleted all my CSS stylesheets and completed every styling with TailWind. It took me about a week to review the basics of JS, Nextjs, apply Tailwind, and to create this website.

I admit that I still lack a lot of knowledge on web devleopment, and I am excited to learn more as I frequently renovate this website. Thanks for reading!

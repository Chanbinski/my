## Summary: I ask, I answer

**What is happiness?**

- Happiness is flow.

**How do you achieve happiness?**

- You must control consciousness.

**What is consciousness?**

- Consciousness transforms outer world events into internal information and stores them so that the body can act upon them.

**How does consciousness work?**

- There are three important concepts that rule the consciousness: intention, attention, and the self.
  - Intention gives an order to the information in consciousness. It is manifested as desire, drive, need, or instinct. Intention itself is organized through the hierarchy of goals.
  - Attention or psychic energy is a filter that accepts only certain information to be stored in the consciousness.
  - The self, or I, exists in the consciousness and represents all of its content. It shapes the consciousness, but it is also shaped by the consciousness.

**What is flow?**

- Flow is a state when attention can be freely used to achieve goals. It adds order and complexity to consciousness.
- Psychic entropy, or chaos, takes place when information that conflicts with one's goal appears. One must allocate attention to eliminate the danger, which prevents one to be in the flow state.

**How does flow equate to happiness?**

- Flow is an unlimited source of enjoyment, beyond pleasure.

**What is the difference between enjoyment and pleasure?**

- Pleasure is a feeling of fulfillment when information in consciousness meets biological or social expectations. On the other hand, enjoyment is a feeling of fulfillment when information in consciousness meets its own goals or goes beyond them.
- While pleasure can be experienced without investing any psychic energy, enjoyment requires a great amount of psychic energy. Pleasure helps to maintain order in consciousness, while enjoyment creates new orders, adding complexity to consciousness.

**How does one achieve enjoyment (i.e. be in a flow state)?**

- Enjoyment comes from doing a challenging activity, although it should be doable with the skills you possess. The activity should provide clear goals and feedback so you can continue the activity. You need to be deeply focused so that all of your attention is spent doing it. When you are in a flow state, you lose self-consciousness and become unaware of yourself. Self-consciousness is the most common source of distraction. However, you should be careful not to be addicted to that activity.

**What are some examples of flow?**

- Any activity can be a flow activity. What matters is how you do, not what you do. The book gives examples of how people transformed mundane activities into flow activity across four big categories: body, thought, work, and relationships. Read the book for more information!

**How does one cope with stress, or psychic disorder?**

- One must trust himself, the environment, and his place in it. Especially, it is important to minimize the time spent on oneself (one's needs, socially conditioned desires) but maximize it on understanding the environment. Although their attention is set by their goals, they are open to the environment, and this openness allows them to be objective and aware of alternative possibilities.
- Moreover, this allows you to transform potential threats into enjoyable challenges, which leads to an order in the consciousness and inner harmony. The goals should emerge from yourself, not by social norms or biological needs.

**What is the meaning of life?**

- Turning life into a single, unified flow experience is the last key that the flow theory presents. Life may have no meaning strictly in biological terms, but it doesn't mean that life cannot be given meaning. To achieve this, one must find a single goal so that one can orient all of his flow activities toward this goal.

## Thoughts

Before reading the book, I personally experienced that overcoming challenges, big or small, is extremely enjoyable and adds complexity to myself. After graduating high school in Korea, I had over 6 months until college. Bored, I started to set a challenge/goal for each month and recorded my progress every day to see how I improved at the end of the month. Some included increasing typing speed, publishing a chrome extension, building a personal blog from scratch, and reading for 30 minutes right before going to bed. Now I realize I was in a flow state when involved in these activities. Unfortunately, I ceased establishing monthly goals after class started because classes and socializing already provided me with challenges, so I did not feel the need to set additional goals. However, after reading this book, I realized that this way of constantly challenging myself is a unique way to try out new things, achieve flow and create complexity in my consciousness. If I find one challenge particularly interesting, then I could dive deep into that challenge and find a new interest. In this sense, I can say that the book's value and my value coincided.

## The Problem

The world emits 51 billion tons of greenhouse gas per year. If this trend continues, the average temperature of Earth will increase by 1.5 ~ 3 degrees by mid-century and 4 ~ 8 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century. But what does this mean? By 2050, 14 people, and by 2100, 75 per 100,000 people are projected to die because of global warming which is **five times as deadly as COVID-19**. And remember, this will worsen every year if we don't make any improvements.

How does global warming kill people? Well, you've probably heard of countries that are being affected by rising sea levels. But this is just the drop of the bucket. As the temperature rises, the air gets hotter and holds more moisture. More water evaporates to the air from soil and plants, causing storms, droughts, and wildfires. These disasters will ruin farmlands and destroy the livings of people. Moreover, numerous people will die because of heatstroke.

At the heart of this threat, there is the infamous greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases is a collection of gases that absorb heat and trap it in the atmosphere. When sunlight enters the atmosphere and is reflected by the surface of the Earth, it cannot escape but are trapped by the gases, causing global warming. Carbon dioxide is the most well known GHG, but there are methane, nitrous oxide, and even water vapor on the list.

## What Should We Do?

Three evident, but important steps to avoid this threat are the following.

1. We need to emit zero greenhouse gases.
2. We need to install existing solutions efficiently.
3. We need to make breakthroughs.

Some overlook the magnitude of the consequences of global warming. We **must** get to zero emissions because reducing GHG isn't getting rid of it. Also, we are not operating at full potential with existing zero-carbon solutions, which is a significant loss. However, deploying solar panels, wind turbines, and nuclear reactors, is just one part of the story. We need breakthroughs, and Gates introduces to us a lot of them throughout his book.

## The 5 Sectors

There are largely five activities that produce greenhouse gas. Here are the problems we are facing right now. Check out the books if you want to learn more about the solutions we have and need.

### 1. Generating Electricity

Currently, two-thirds of electricity generated worldwide is fossil fuels, which include coal, natural gas, and oil. It's so popular because they are easy to transport and are very cheap. Electricity generation is the biggest problem among the five because it relates to all of them, as you will see in the following sections.

### 2. Manufacturing (cement, steel, plastic)

When creating steel, cement, and plastic, we need to heat. This mostly comes from burning fossil fuels at present. Moreover, this process reacts oxygen with carbon, creating CO<sub>2</sub>.

### 3. Agriculture

When cows burp and fart, they release methane. There are roughly a billion cattle raised for beef and dairy, which accounts for about 4 percent of annual global emissions. Moreover, when animal poop decomposes, it releases a mix of greenhouse gas, which is the second-biggest cause of emissions in agriculture.
We produce ammonia when creating synthetic fertilizers, and this requires heat earned by burning fossil fuels. Even worse, it is sprayed by gasoline-powered vehicles.
When you take a tree out of the ground, the carbon in the soil gets released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. In fact, there's more carbon in the soil than in the atmosphere and all plant life combined!

### 4. Transportation

Manufacturing a car accounts for a lot of emissions because of the reason stated in section 2, and many cars are powered by gasoline produced by fossil fuels.

### 5. Heating and Cooling

Air conditioning emits F-gas, which is an extremely powerful GHG (causes thousands of times more warming than carbon dioxide). A/C heavily relies on electricity. Also, most of the heating sources such as furnaces and water heaters run on fossil fuels.

## Final Thoughts

One of the key arguments of this book is that climate change is an economical problem.

1. We need to make carbon free solutions as cheap as the carbon emitting source because consumers won't use it if not.
2. Companies invest when they see a way to make a profit out of the new idea. Thus, governments should invest in energy R&D when companies don't because of the uncertainty of generating revenue.

We should look at this problem from a global prospective as well. One thing that bothered me while reading the book was that even though the world's poor are contributing the least to climate change, they will suffer the most from it. This is because when you're already living on the edge, any one of the consequences can be catastrophic.

Climate change is very complicated. We are far from zero, and we don't fully understand the consequences yet. However, Bill Gates says,

> I'm an optimist because I know what technology can accomplish and because I know what people can accomplish. I'm profoundly inspired by all the passion I see, especially among young people, for solving this problem.

Hi, welcome to my blog! If you didn't check out my profile yet, visit [here](/). Anyway, I created this blog to display my interests, opinions, and projects. Moreover, it's always a good thing to keep track of everything in one place, because they will eventually accumulate and elevate my personal brand.

Coding my blog from scratch was always one of my dreams. Although I've been coding for about four years, I was unfamiliar with web programming. After I decided to get some hands-on experience in this field, I studied various languages and frameworks, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Django, mainly through YouTube videos. I didn't want to study any backend services since my only purpose was to create a personal blog.

One day, I came across Next.js. It is considered one of the best React frameworks to create static sites because of its powerful features like server-side rendering (SSR), search engine optimization (SEO), and automatic routing. Because I had some basic knowledge on React, I started to work on my blog with this framework.

Of course, I didn't build this website all by myself. I structured my basic layout and applied data extraction from Markdown files referring to this [post](https://medium.com/geekculture/build-a-blog-with-next-js-2315d9683ef) by Matthew Brown. Then, I watched Harry Wolff's YouTube series, _How To Build A Blog With Next.js And Tailwind_ ([Github Repository](https://github.com/hswolff/blog-with-nextjs-and-tailwind) for the episodes), realizing how powerful Tailwind CSS was. I deleted all my CSS stylesheets and completed every styling with TailWind. It took me about a week to publish this website.

I admit that I still lack a lot of knowledge on web development, and I am excited to learn more as I frequently renovate this website. Thanks for reading!

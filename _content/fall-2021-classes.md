Fall 2021 was a great semester. As a freshman interested in computer science, 
I took COMPSCI 61A, MATH 54, AGRS 10A, and MCELLBI 90E (freshman seminar).

### COMPSCI 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
The most important thing I learned in this class was **problem solving**. Rather than going deep into how computers work, 61A focused on using programming to solve problems, relying on high-level abstraction.

The lectures were very organized. I especially liked professor John DeNero's playlist lectures because they were concise and easy to understand. I also love his pronunciation. 

However, the exams are very harder than the problems we solve during discussion or lab. For me, the exams were like puzzles that test how you think, rather than if you know the content or not. Solving past exam problems is the best way to get familiarized with the exam format and difficulty. 

Overall, it was a great course: very organized, plenty of available resources, teaches you computational thinking.

### MATH 54: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations
Math 54 was my first math class that involved abstract concepts. I was confused at first but was able to
understand them. 

### AGRS 10A: Introduction to Ancient Greece
One most important skill I acquired from this class is the ability to "read against the grain." The class focussed very much on how to read and interpret literary masterpieces from ancient Greece. Professor Telo introduces interpretations that are against the dominant reading of the text, which was very intriguing. 

### MCELLBI 90E: Freshman Seminar - Matter, Mind, Consciousness
Best course ever taken so far. In this class, we covered so many topics that are related to matter, mind, and consciousness: unique experiences (NDE, OBE, past life, etc), psi-phenomena (extrasensory perception, precognition, etc), time, UFOs, quantum physics, lucid dreaming, and much more.

These are some of the points I found interesting:
* We need to adopt a more expansive metaphysical frame, not just accepting the current scientific frame that describes consciousness as a result of neuron interactions.
* There are a lot of unexplainable (unexplainable through our current scientific framework) phenomena that are taking place all around the world. 
* Quantum physics seems to be closely linked to consciousness, as quantum theory shows that reality could be constructed differently according to the observer. 
* Consciousness could be shared among people, even between the dead and alive.
* The brain could act as a filter of consciousness which allows us to function properly in the physical world.
